Usage
-----

Registration
============

1.  Register

agentregister( host, user, password, callback, invitecallback, serverdisconnect )

   host of the signalling server 
   userid / password
   callback for registration complete
   invitecallback to handle incoming invitations to join a webrtc session
   serverdisconnectcallback notification the server has disconnected this agent
   
If the callback indicates registration fails then the user is asked to attempt registration again (Step 1)   

2.  Find out who else is present.

agentregistrations(callback)
 
   Register a callback to return a list of active users.  This callback fires for notications of changes in the presencd of users.

Making a call
=============

3a.  Make a call

 agentinvite(remoteusername, callback)
 
Invite remoteusername to a call.  The callback will handle the response - accepted or rejected.
If rejected then return to Step 2.

4a.  Webrtc session setup

  agentconnect(useAudio, userVideo, bool isCaller, sessionclosecallback, mediasuccesscallback, mediafailedcallback);
  
  useAudio :  true/false
  useVideo : true/false 
  isCaller : true/false  (did we sent the invite (true), or did we respond positively to an invite (false))
  sessionclosecallback :   fires if the session closes.  Connection lost, far end agent hangs up
  mediasuccess :  fires if/when connection made and media established
  mediafailedcallback :  fires if we have failed to create local media streams.
  
5a.  Begin media neotiation:
  
  agentcreateoffer()   

6a.  If successful the session will start and audio and video streams will flow.
  
  
Handling an inccoming call
===========================
From  Step 1 or 2 above.

3b.  The invitecallback from Step 1 fires.

4b.  Either call agentrejectinvitation ending the transaction and returning  to Step 1 or 2 above. 
               OR
            call agentconnect(....)  in this case setting isCaller to false. (See 4a for api)

5b.  The mediasuccess callback fires
            call agentacceptinvitation

6b.   If successful the session will start and audio and video streams will flow

Ending a call
=============

Whether this agent or the remote agent  has initiated the disconnect, agentdisconnect is called. Typicall agentregistrations would next be called to refresh the list of userids present.
